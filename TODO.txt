Slam Stick Lab To-Do List
=========================

*Note:* See also the mide_ebml TODO list, as wekk as the individual TODO items 
noted in the code ("TODO:" in comments, "@todo" in doc strings. This list 
includes some of the latter, but not all.

Major items
-----------
Mac OS port. The bulk of the code will 'just work,' but there are a couple of
things (recorder identification, etc.) which will need to be rewritten. Some
of the UI looks kind of weird on a Mac with a Retina display, but this may be
wxPython and not easily corrected. Future releases of wxPython may look better.

FFT fix. The vertical scale is off. The smaller the window, the lower the
maximum gets. Also gets lower with larger ranges. I think something is
calculating a mean of the amplitudes in each window -- smaller windows will 
get less variation in them, so they average differently. 


Minor items
-----------
Calculate FFT/Spectrograms in another thread or with wx.lib.delayedresult to
prevent the app from being labeled "(Not Responding)" by the OS. This bugs me,
a lot, but it's hard to get it bumped in priority.


Longer term
-----------



'Wish List' items ("it would be nice if...")
