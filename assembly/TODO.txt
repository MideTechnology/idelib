Slam Stick Birthing/Calibration to-do list
==========================================

Major items
-----------
Separate calibration script from the birthing script, so one can be more safely
modified while limiting damage to the other. Probably not too difficult.


Minor items
-----------
Refactor the calibration script to work without a physical Slam Stick, using
only data stored in the recorder's calibration folder on the network. Not
too urgent, but there have been a couple of cases where the calibration script
produced bad results on shipped units and we had to recalculate.
