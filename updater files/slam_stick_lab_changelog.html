          <h3>1.4.2</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Version <b>1.4.2</b> is a maintenance release, containing various improvements and minor bug fixes.</p>
      <p>Changes in 1.4.2 include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Improved timing accuracy in plots.</li>
          <li>New "Tools" Menu, featuring GUI versions of the IDE file splitter
              and raw-to-MATLAB&reg; command-line utilities. </li>
          <li>New Slam Stick X&trade; configuration options, including USB
              attachment behavior and channel configuration.</li>
          <li>New Slam Stick X&trade; firmware updating utility. This appears
              under the <b>Device</b> menu if the <i>Show Advanced Options</i>
              preference is checked. This feature requires firmware update
              files, which will be released in the near future.</li>
          <li>Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor UI improvements.</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>1.4.1</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Version <b>1.4.1</b> is a significant update, recommended for all users.</p>
      <p>Changes in 1.4 include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><font color="red">Multiple Axes per Plot</font></b>
            <ul><li>
            The most significant change in this version is the ability to
                plot multiple sources (axes) together in the main view. The
                majority of the changes in 1.4.x relate to this new functionality.
            </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>New <i>View</i> Menu Items
            <ul>
                <li><i>Create New Tab:</i> Additional tabs can be created via this menu. Each tab is limited to a single measurement type, specified at the time of creation. </li>
                <li><i>Display Channels:</i> The display of individual channels of data can be turned on and off. Measurement types that are incompatible with the selected tab are disabled. </li>
                <li><i>Show Legend:</i> Toggle the floating legend display. The legend is described in more detail below.</li>
                <li><i>'Hollow' Envelope Drawing:</i> With this mode turned on, the standard 'condensed' view (used when the number of points on screen exceeds the number of pixels) draws only the minimum and maximum, leaving the space between them empty. This is particularly useful when displaying multiple channels of data with differing amplitudes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>New <i>Data</i> Menu Item
            <ul>
                <li><i>Display Warning Ranges:</i> Some types of sensor only produce
                    reliable results in specific conditions. The 832M1 Accelerometer
                    in the Slam Stick X&trade;, for example, performs best at temperatures
                    between -20 and 60&deg;C; the default warning range displayed for
                    accelerometer channels highlights periods during which the
                    temperature is outside of this range. This replaces the
                    single-purpose "Show Temperature Range Warnings" menu item,
                    paving the way for additional sensors in future Mid&eacute;
                    data recorder products.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>New Preferences
            <ul>
                <li><i>Initial Display Layout:</i> This new option specifies the contents of the default tabs shown after loading a recording.
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>One Channel Per Tab:</i> The old behavior.</li>
                        <li><i>One Tab Per Sensor:</i> Channels of the same type, generated by the same sensor, are grouped together. For Slam Stick X&trade;, this produces three tabs: one containing the three accelerometer axes, one containing pressure, and one containing temperature.</li>
                        <li><i>One Tab Per Type:</i> Channels of the same type are grouped together, regardless of the sensor that recorded them. Note: For recordings made on current Slam Stick X&trade; hardware, this is identical to the One Tab Per Sensor option.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><i>Legend Position:</i> This specifies the corner of the screen on which the legend overlay is drawn. This applies specifically to the legend displayed in the main window, not rendered FFT/PSD/Spectrogram/Plot views.</li>
                <li><i>Reset Plot Colors</i> (button at bottom): User-edited plot colors are now saved; this option resets those colors to the defaults.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Legend Display:</i> This overlay lists the colors and names of the channels currently displayed in a tab. Right-clicking items allows editing of the drawing order, plot colors, and the position of the legend.
        </li>
        <li>Support for the latest Slam Stick X&trade; firmware</li>
        <li>Various minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.3.0</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Version <b>1.3.0</b> is a significant update, recommended for all users.</p>
    <p>Changes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="red">PSD (Power Spectral Density) calculation</font>
        <ul>
          <li>Default setting uses the FFT results and plots results of g<sup>2</sup>/Hz versus frequency</li>
          <li>A windowed calculation (using Welch's method) can also be selected that will plot dB/Hz versus frequency
            <ul>
              <li>This method provides better frequency information and will calculate faster</li>
              <li>The smaller the window size the faster it will compute but the less "fine" the frequency information will be</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="red">Unit conversion</font>
        <ul>
          <li>Display acceleration in <i>g</i> or m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
          <li>Display pressure in Pascals, PSI, or atm</li>
          <li>Display pressure as altitude in meters or feet</li>
          <li>Display temperature in &deg;C, &deg;F, or &deg;K</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Improved plotting
        <ul>
          <li>A feature under preferences, "Oversampling Multiplier", has been
            added which controls how many data points per pixel width of plot
            window is plotted</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The default used to be 2, now it defaults to 25. Plotting will
              take about a second longer but many more data points will be
              shown. This setting is user selectable, the higher the number the
              more data that will be plotted; but the plot window will take
              longer to refresh.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Overall performance improvements.</li>
      <li><font color="red">New feedback feature under the <b>Help</b> menu</font></li>

        Stick X&trade; recordings) has been made substantially faster, improving
        performance in almost all operations.</li>
      <li>Visual improvements to the Rendered Plot/FFT/Spectrogram views.</li>
      <li>Intensive Spectrogram and FFT calculations are less likely to cause
        the application to appear frozen. FFT and Spectrogram calculation can
        also be interrupted.</li>
