      <h3>1.3.0</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Version <b>1.3.0</b> is a significant update, recommended for all users.</p>
    <p>Changes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="red">PSD (Power Spectral Density) calculation</font>
        <ul>
          <li>Default setting uses the FFT results and plots results of g<sup>2</sup>/Hz versus frequency</li>
          <li>A windowed calculation (using Welch's method) can also be selected that will plot dB/Hz versus frequency
            <ul>
              <li>This method provides better frequency information and will calculate faster</li>
              <li>The smaller the window size the faster it will compute but the less "fine" the frequency information will be</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="red">Unit conversion</font>
        <ul>
          <li>Display acceleration in <i>g</i> or m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
          <li>Display pressure in Pascals, PSI, or atm</li>
          <li>Display pressure as altitude in meters or feet</li>
          <li>Display temperature in &deg;C, &deg;F, or &deg;K</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Improved plotting
        <ul>
          <li>A feature under preferences, "Oversampling Multiplier", has been
            added which controls how many data points per pixel width of plot
            window is plotted</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The default used to be 2, now it defaults to 25. Plotting will
              take about a second longer but many more data points will be
              shown. This setting is user selectable, the higher the number the
              more data that will be plotted; but the plot window will take
              longer to refresh.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Overall performance improvements.</li>
      <li><font color="red">New feedback feature under the <b>Help</b> menu</font></li>
      <li>Various small UI fixes and improvements.</li>
    </ul>

      improvements.</p>
    <p>Changes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temperature-based calibration (as applied to the accelerometer in Slam
        Stick X&trade; recordings) has been made substantially faster, improving
        performance in almost all operations.</li>
      <li>Visual improvements to the Rendered Plot/FFT/Spectrogram views.</li>
      <li>Intensive Spectrogram and FFT calculations are less likely to cause
        the application to appear frozen. FFT and Spectrogram calculation can
        also be interrupted.</li>
      <li>Support for 2000 g Slam Stick X&trade; recorders.</li>
      <li>Various small UI and performance improvements.</li>
    </ul>
