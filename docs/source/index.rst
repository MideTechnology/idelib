IDELib: a Python Library for accessing enDAQ sensor recordings
==============================================================

`idelib` is a Python API for accessing `enDAQ <https://endaq.com/>`_'s IDE recordings. The IDE format is an `EBML <https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification>`_ encoded file using a custom schemata.
